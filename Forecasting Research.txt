Notes
-We are going to work with multivariate data, so we need to choose a model that can use multivariate data

-We also know there is obvious seasonality because there are more fires during the dry season than the wet season.

-Need to see if there is a time trend.

-Need to adjust data for seasonality/time trend then add these components back at the end for our model prediction.

-For the Train-Validation split, we should leave out a time frame at the end to compare our data to (possibly leave out the last year?),
 this will allow us to check the accuracy of out model. Then for the actual final model, we add back the testing split.

-Probably use VAR as our model, but we can play around with other multivariate models.



ORIGINAL PLAN:

I think we can cluster coordinates by strips of longitude, and create dummy variables based on these clusterings.
Also, other basic data cleaning stuff.

Then, I need to remove seasonality and trends, and then that means we can apply VAR. 
(We can remove the last year of the training data to see how accurate our model is).

Then, after we get the model working, we can use the updated GEE API data for our model and re-train it on that new data,
and check that it works again by leaving out the last year. (How do we get the most recent burn area?- No API is lised on Zindi)

Then, we use this model to create an app that visualizes burn area through 2025.


PROBLEMS:

Working with a VAR model is actually quite difficult, and after testing with a SARIMA model I got pretty good results.
Sadly, SARIMA is univariate, we will lose some really nice data that we could have gotten from GEE.

NEW PLAN: 

We can reduce the amount of areas we want to model over by taking the average burn area over different locations and
then we can run a SARIMA model on each of these locations.
